job is likely a job in robotics engineering, designing, and programming robots
to assist humanity in doing dangerous, dirty, or demeaning jobs that would make
life easier for all involved. I would require my bachelor of IT and likely a
degree in engineering for this job I will also need many skills in programming
and likely coordination skills with a team of people, I currently possess a
keen attention to detail and great hand eye coordination which will be necessary
skills in this field. I plan to acquire the information and skills needed
through my tertiary studies. Picture from ‘<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:#4472C4'>Overview</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>My project will be a video game in which
you build a robot to perform tasks and as you do task the complexity of your
robot and the complexity or difficulty of the task also improves. The jobs can
be simple like taking out trash or driving complicated and simple vehicles for
construction and transportation, and the player will have an opportunity to
build edit and recreate their robot before a level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:red'>Motivation </span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This project will cause me to research and
gain information into the types of tasks robots could be designed for and allow
me to create a fun experience for players. It will also teach players the types
of implementations for robots and hopefully educate them as to why robots are
so necessary and de-romanticise and de-demonize robots in modern society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:#FFC000'>Description</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The game will be closely similar to spore
and games such as surgeon simulator or “Freudian games” these are games which
feature great difficulty due to ragdoll physics or frustrating control schemes
that the enjoyment comes from the fulfilment of completion or the fun of the
wacky ragdolls and funny positions you can find yourself in, this is because I
personally find these types of games really fun and innovative and love the
ragdoll physics in games like this that add so much hilarity and flavour to the
experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> The game will take inspiration from games
such as a spore and crossout in the creation of your robot and will have many
parts and abilities to edit and change your robot to find maximum creativity
and have key components which will be necessary for each certain level such as
specific tools or even as basic as making a robot with hands or wheels. This
comes from my childhood where spore was my first and most beloved game, I want
my first IT project to reflect myself and my childhood is sourced from the
amazing time playing spore. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The idea is to have the game bring out
people’s creativity and problem-solving skills. It will have a basic cartoon
sort of art style popularised somewhere in between Fortnite and Roblox similar
to a lot of other indie games, it will feature high contrast and saturated
colours to grab attention of potentially younger players similar to the
colourful nature of games such as no man’s sky or spore with graphics similar
to smaller indie games with less detail and realism as opposed to games like
Skyrim or Cyberpunk the idea is an unrealistic, cartoony style of game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The colour palette will be similar to
games such as Stardew valley and Terraria with high vibrancy and colourful
tones, the art style and colour palette are essential to get right as it
determines the breadth of our potential audience if the colour palette is to
shallow and dull we will likely struggle attracting younger players and if the
art style is to heavily detailed and realistic it will be impossible for the
game to be completed within a reasonable time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:red'>Tools and Technologies</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> Adobe software’s such as Premier
Photoshop and illustrator will likely be needed as well as blender for models
and textures the game will likely be developed on the unity engine and use a
lot of features from there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Skills Required – The project will take a
great deal of creativity perseverance and attention to detail. It requires no
special hardware apart from my desktop computer and the skills necessary of the
software to be written will be taught in my course and picked up from other
public sources.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:#7030A0'>Outcome</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If the project is successful, I will have
made a fully functioning fun and interesting game for people to play and enjoy
it would likely also help people realise how robots are necessary to not take
over jobs but assist them by being controlled by a worker and allowing the jobs
we so despise to be much easier than they currently are without all the pain
and effort. The impact of the development depends on the popularity of the
program but if in theory it takes off it will help with public understanding of
robotics and hopefully give some people a smile.</span></p>
